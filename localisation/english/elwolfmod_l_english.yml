 VIC_devalue_the_franc_desc:1 "While other countries allowed their currencies to become less valuable to help their economies, we have steadfastly refused to do so. As a result, our economy is lagging behind others. If we want to become more competitive and weather the coming storm, we must not dismiss a devaluation of our currency out of hand, even if it would prove to be an unpopular measure."

 VIC_invest_in_syria:0 "Invest In Syria"
 VIC_invest_in_syria_desc:0 "Syria is perfectly positioned to supply us in case of a war in Europe or Africa. Enhancing its industrial potential will also support our position in the area."

 VIC_methodical_battle:0 "Methodical Battle"
 VIC_methodical_battle_desc:0 "Some claim that battle is chaos, but they are fools. A battle is nothing but the methodical application of the right tools based on the overall plan. Plan well, and the enemy's intentions may as well be a historical footnote."

 VIC_special_forces:0 "Special Forces"
 VIC_special_forces_desc:0 "In the future, the war will increasingly be fought in areas where the regular infantryman will meet his limit. We must create new and more capable formations that can perform in these conditions."

 VIC_battle_of_maneuver:0 "Battle of Maneuver"
 VIC_battle_of_maneuver_desc:0 "The old notion of a battlefield as a small area in which armies clash is dead. With mass-motorization, airplanes and fast radio communications, battles move fast over hundreds of kilometers. The sooner we prepare for this, the better."
 VIC_air_dominance_desc:0 "The development of the airplane has created a third flank for the army to worry about. We must secure this flank or face catastrophe."
 VIC_air_ground_cooperation:0 "Air-Ground Cooperation"
 VIC_air_ground_cooperation_desc:0 "Fighting in the air only ever creates actual military results if it is in pursuit of an objective on the ground. The better we integrate the battle in the air and the battle on the ground, the more effective we become."
 VIC_flying_artillery_desc:0 "In the fast-moving battles of today, the slow artillery pieces on the ground might not be able to keep up. Airplanes carrying bombs can take over their role."
 VIC_form_the_popular_front:0 "Form the Popular Front"
 VIC_form_the_popular_front_desc:1 "With the rise of fascism in Germany and Italy, it has become clear that the infighting on the left has to stop if our cause is to survive. A broad, popular front made up of all the parties on the left will have the popular mandate to finally address the economic conditions that create fascism."
 VIC_ban_communism_desc:0 "While it is inconceivable that anyone could seriously want to visit the chaos and bloodshed of a communist revolution upon their own fatherland, it appears that there are some amongst us who would do just that. We can not allow them to conspire against the state any longer. The harshest measures must be taken."
 VIC_invite_communist_ministers:0 "Invite Communist Ministers"

 VIC_industrial_collectivization:0 "Industrial Collectivization"
 VIC_industrial_collectivization_desc:1 "The French economy today consists of tiny companies with few employees, forever competing against each other and sucking up resources in inefficient small-scale production. We will combine these small companies to finally create companies that can compete on the world stage."
 VIC_agricultural_collectivization_desc:0 "What applies to industry applies just as much to the farmers all across France. Tiny farms can't afford modern equipment, largely working as their great-grandfathers had. By combining them into agricultural production units, we will increase efficiency and output."
 VIC_force_the_issue:0 "Force the Issue"
 VIC_force_the_issue_desc:1 "We have come far since we formed the Popular Front. But we can not leave our work half-done. It is time for everyone on the left to make a choice and take a stand - either with the revolution or against it."

 VIC_reconciliation:0 "Reconciliation"
 VIC_reconciliation_desc:0 "In the past, the French revolutions all too often hurled the country into endless spasms of revolutionary and counter-revolutionary terror. Perhaps it is time to build a republic in which everyone has their place, whether they supported the revolution or not."

 VIC_invite_anti_fascist_emigrants:0 "Invite Anti-Fascist Immigrants"
 VIC_invite_anti_fascist_emigrants_desc:1 "The first step every fascist regime takes is to exile its critics and the people who could present an alternative vision of how the country could be organized. However, these people are also perfectly suited to form a government-in-exile to prepare for the day their country is liberated."
 VIC_reconnect_to_the_balkans:0 "Reconnect To the Balkans"
 VIC_reconnect_to_the_balkans_desc:0 "France has long sought to counter-balance the powers of central Europe by reaching out to the countries of the Balkans. This connection is still there, even if it has been allowed to lapse more recently."

 VIC_loyalty_to_moscow:0 "Loyalty To Moscow"
 VIC_loyalty_to_moscow_desc:0 "The model of Socialism practiced in the Soviet Union might not be perfect, but it is beyond any reasonable doubt that the Soviet Union has achieved the highest degree of implementation of socialist ideas. We would be fools to try and find our own way."
 VIC_league_of_french_bolshevist_volunteers_desc:1 "When one socialist country is under threat by a foreign invader, all socialist countries are under threat. We must not sit idly by while our comrades fight for their lives."
 VIC_host_the_german_exiles:0 "Host the German Exiles"
 VIC_host_the_german_exiles_desc:0 "Germany, the home of Marx and Engels, was once at the forefront of communist thought and practice. Many German communists fled when the Nazis took power. If we give them a home, they can help us organize a more effective government of liberated territories."
 VIC_revolution_to_the_utmost:0 "Revolution To the Utmost"

 VIC_destroy_the_counter_revolution:0 "Destroy the Counter-Revolution"
 VIC_destroy_the_counter_revolution_desc:0 "Even now, some people in France prepare to stab the dagger into the back of their own people when they show even a second of weakness. We will not let them, and will strike first."

 VIC_loyalty_to_the_cause:0 "Loyalty To the Cause"
 VIC_loyalty_to_the_cause_desc:1 "Other countries may formulate their own visions of Communism, but there is no reason why we should compromise on ours. They may have stopped half-way, beset by doubt over whether the end justified the means. We won't."
 VIC_carry_the_revolution_north:0 "Carry the Revolution North"

 VIC_carry_the_revolution_south:0 "Carry the Revolution South"
 VIC_carry_the_revolution_south_desc:0 "The first country to fall to fascism was Italy. As a result, the ideology is firmly entrenched in Italy. Our world-views can not peacefully coexist. They know this as well as we do, and will no doubt prepare to act. So must we."
 VIC_egalite_liberte_solidarite_desc:1 "The first French Revolution swept away regimes that had lasted for a millennia, and changed the landscape of Europe forever. We will finish what they started."
 VIC_reform_the_labour_laws:0 "Reform the Labour Laws"

 VIC_ban_the_leagues:0 "Ban the Leagues"
 VIC_ban_the_leagues_desc:0 "The far-right leagues have been allowed to organize unchecked. While they are currently too weak to try a coup, there is no telling of what they might be able to do in the future. Best to dissolve them now."
 VIC_the_blum_viollette_proposal:0 "The Blum-Viollette Proposal"
 VIC_the_blum_viollette_proposal_desc:1 "The citizenship of the French Republic should be open to anyone who qualifies. Many of our loyal subjects in Algeria would like to become full citizens, but are not yet allowed to do so. By making them full citizens, we would bind Algeria much closer to France."
 VIC_expand_the_citizenship:0 "Expand the Citizenship"
 VIC_expand_the_citizenship_desc:0 "It is intolerable for a republic that some of the people living on her territory would not be allowed to become her citizens, yet this state of affairs has been allowed to persist in our own. We must rectify this at once."

 VIC_french_union:0 "French Union"

 VIC_encourage_immigration:0 "Encourage Immigration"
 VIC_encourage_immigration_desc:1 "Our homeland is in desperate need of workers to make up for the losses incurred in the Great War. By making it easier to settle in France, we can attract the skilled immigrants that can make up for this shortfall."

 VIC_confirm_eastern_commitments:0 "Confirm Eastern Commitments"
 VIC_confirm_eastern_commitments_desc:0 "After the Great War, we set up a network of alliances in Eastern Europe, as a counter-weight to a resurgent Germany and an expansionist Soviet Union. Our allies in the region are now wondering if we would actually come to their aid if we were called. We should reassure them before they decide to seek help elsewhere."
 VIC_strengthen_the_little_entente:0 "Strengthen the Little Entente"

 VIC_invest_in_our_weaker_allies_desc:0 "If we are to have capable allies in case of war, we must enable them to meet their own military needs. A program of moderate investments into their industry will allow them to produce the munitions they need locally."

 VIC_foreign_guest_workers:0 "Foreign Guest-Workers"
 VIC_foreign_guest_workers_desc:0 "Our lack of workers is a major bottleneck in expanding our industry and growing the size of our armed forces. Inviting skilled workers from our allies to work in our factories frees up manpower to send into the army."
 VIC_join_the_ententes:0 "Join the Ententes"
 VIC_join_the_ententes_desc:1 "France can not sustain two commitments of mutual defense at the same time. Unless we can get the British to agree to honor our commitments as well, we would have to choose.

 VIC_arms_purchases_in_the_us_desc:0 "Our military industry is simply not up to the task of supplying our forces with the necessary modern weapons. The US, however, has production capacity to spare. Unless they decide to return to their isolationism, it would seem that they could be persuaded to sell us the weapons we need."

 VIC_laissez_faire:0 "Laissez-Faire"
 VIC_laissez_faire_desc:0 "The Communists openly talk about remodelling the economic structure of our country in some radical way, of depriving the hard-working man of his rightful property. Against this, we will set the simple notion of freedom. A dynamic economy will always outperform a leftist nightmare of strangulating red tape."
 VIC_protect_the_rights_of_man:0 "Protect the Rights of Man"
 VIC_protect_the_rights_of_man_desc:0 "They may never say it openly, but it is obvious to anyone with eyes to see: curtailing the right to property is just the first step to eliminating all the rights our proud ancestors fought so hard for. We will not have it!"
 VIC_freedom_front:0 "Freedom Front"

 VIC_stimulate_the_dynamic_market:0 "Stimulate the Dynamic Market"
 VIC_stimulate_the_dynamic_market_desc:0 "The dynamic market has been proven to be the most efficient form of economic organization. But it is still run by humans, and human beings sometimes need some reassurances that their hard work will not be in vain. By legislating away some restrictions and giving guarantees, we can help investors overcome their fears and help stimulate our economy."
 VIC_agricultural_protectionism_desc:0 "The world economy has grown more and more hostile to our traditional ways of production. If we do not take measures to protect our farmers, we will soon face a crisis of untold proportions as our farmers are unable to remain competitive in the face of mass-produced foodstuffs coming in from overseas."
 VIC_economic_devolution:0 "Economic Devolution"
 VIC_economic_devolution_desc:0 "It is absurd to think that some bureaucrat in Paris knows what is best for a company in Bordeaux. We must trust our entrepeneurs and empower them to create their own solutions."
 VIC_promote_entrepeneurship:0 "Promote Entrepeneurship"
 VIC_promote_entrepeneurship_desc:0 "The beating heart of a dynamic market has always been the individual who, upon seeing an opportunity, moves quickly to exploit it. In recent years, this spirit has been smothered with unnecessary regulations. We should roll them back."
 VIC_utilize_the_leagues:0 "Utilize the Leagues"
 VIC_utilize_the_leagues_desc:0 "It is a sad fact that political violence has become commonplace in France. If the country is to survive the threat of communist revolution, we must not shy away from the help of people who can and will meet the communist thugs in the street if it comes to that."

 VIC_destroy_decadence:0 "Destroy Decadence"

 VIC_political_unity:0 "Political Unity"
 VIC_political_unity_desc:1 "The history of France since the fall of absolutism has been a story of political infighting. When there was unity - France was victorious.

 VIC_diplomatic_freedom:0 "Diplomatic Freedom"
 VIC_diplomatic_freedom_desc:1 "The republican governments have shackled themselves to artificial constructs in Eastern Europe who will fall the moment we withdraw our aid. They are liabilities, not assets, and as such we will divest ourselves of them."

 VIC_the_natural_borders_of_france_desc:0 "It is only natural that a country should look to its own interests first. We can not peacefully coexist with the Germans in our struggle, and so we must secure our natural borders to defend our heartlands."
 VIC_towards_a_new_europe:0 "Towards a New Europe"
 VIC_towards_a_new_europe_desc:1 "France is at a crossroads. We can shackle ourselves to the old order, or we can embrace the new. With the Germans poised to remake the continent, it would be beneficial for us to be on their good side."
 VIC_establish_spheres_of_influence:0 "Establish Spheres of Influence"
 VIC_establish_spheres_of_influence_desc:1 "For centuries, our people have lived in the belief that we were mortal, hereditary enemies.

 VIC_the_council_of_rambouillet_desc:0 "With the country in turmoil, the people look for a strong leader.

 VIC_revise_the_constitution_desc:0 "The republican constitution was always intended to be a stopgap measure that has been allowed to persist for far too long. Now, we will rewrite it to allow a monarch to return."
 VIC_repeal_the_law_of_exile:0 "Repeal the Law of Exile"
 VIC_repeal_the_law_of_exile_desc:0 "No head of a French royal family, nor their heir, are allowed on French soil without express permission. Before we can have the triumphant return of the monarchy, we must dispose of this annoying little obstacle."
 VIC_orleanist_restoration:1 "Orléanist Restoration"
 VIC_orleanist_restoration_desc:2 "The House of Orléans commands considerable support amongst the royalists in France. While some detractors would prefer a different candidate for the throne, there can be little doubt that the Orleanist heir has the best chances to peacefully unite the country behind him."
 VIC_guarantee_the_constitution:0 "Guarantee the Constitution"
 VIC_guarantee_the_constitution_desc:0 "Before the republican press can even launch its unfounded campaigns against the legitimacy of royal rule, we must erode their standing by giving iron-clad guarantees to respect the individual rights of the people."
 VIC_the_first_citizen_of_the_state:0 "The First Citizen of the State"
 VIC_the_first_citizen_of_the_state_desc:0 "The king, while imbued with considerable power, must never be seen as a tyrant or absolutist ruler of the old kind. Instead, a modern monarch must respect the law and be the first line of defense against those that would usurp power illegally."
 VIC_counter_action_desc:0 "The Action Francaise has long been the strongest advocate for a return to the monarchy. Unfortunately, their views on other subjects are less palatable. It is time to inform them that they have served their purpose and dispose of them."
 VIC_no_further_humiliations:0 "No Further Humiliations"
 VIC_no_further_humiliations_desc:0 "For years, successive republican governments have allowed the Germans to run roughshod over international treaties, some of which were brazenly broken before the ink was even dry. This ends now."
 VIC_slum_clearing:0 "Slum Clearing"
 VIC_slum_clearing_desc:0 "Despite being in one of the great powers of the world, the simple French worker often lives in appalling conditions of disgusting squalor. No king worthy of the title can tolerate his subjects living in such a state."
 VIC_public_welfare:0 "Public Welfare"
 VIC_public_welfare_desc:0 "A king who does not work for the least of his subjects is no king at all."
 VIC_the_legitimate_heir:0 "The Legitimate Heir"
 VIC_the_legitimate_heir_desc:1 "The Legitimists consider the Carlist branch to be the legitimate heir to the throne of France. Appointing their candidate to the throne opens up the tantalizing possibility of ruling Spain and France in a double-monarchy."
 VIC_secure_the_crown_of_spain:0 "Secure the Crown of Spain"
 VIC_secure_the_crown_of_spain_desc:0 "The first step towards claiming the king's birthrights is to secure Spain from the various pretender governments that have sprung up. Their petty squabbles have thrown the country into a bloody civil war once already - we must not let them do so again."
 VIC_unite_the_crowns:0 "Unite the Crowns"
 VIC_unite_the_crowns_desc:0 "With Spain secured, we can now unite the crowns and create a new kingdom, the Kingdom of Franco-Spain."
 VIC_two_countries_two_crowns:0 "Two Countries, Two Crowns"
 VIC_two_countries_two_crowns_desc:0 "There is no feasible way in which we could unite the countries where one would not consider itself a subject of the other. We will instead advise the king to rule both in a personal, but not a legal, union."
 VIC_proclaim_the_third_empire:0 "Proclaim the Third Empire"
 VIC_proclaim_the_third_empire_desc:0 "The Bonapartists may be considered the outsiders in the struggle for the throne, but they carry with them the dream of a time when all of Europe bowed to the Emperor of the French."
 VIC_avenge_waterloo:0 "Avenge Waterloo"
 VIC_avenge_waterloo_desc:0 "The history of Napoleon the First will forever be defined by his greatest defeat. If we want to succeed, we must show that we can win where he has lost."
 VIC_reorganize_the_dutch:0 "Reorganize the Dutch"
 VIC_reorganize_the_dutch_desc:0 "The Dutch, too, were once part of the French Empire. Now that they have been defeated, it is time to return to this natural state of affairs."
 VIC_retribution_for_sedan:0 "Retribution For Sedan"
 VIC_retribution_for_sedan_desc:0 "For more than half a century, the Germans have celebrated the Battle of Sedan, and their triumph over Napoleon the Third there. In the future, every German will learn to curse the name of that place."
 VIC_disunite_germany:0 "Disunite Germany"
 VIC_disunite_germany_desc:0 "The triumph over France allowed Prussia to unite the smaller German states under her banner. It is only right that this process is reversed, now that the Germans have been defeated."
 VIC_return_to_borodino:0 "Return To Borodino"
 VIC_return_to_borodino_desc:0 "At Borodino, Napoleon came closest to achieving his victory in Europe. The Russian Army was all but destroyed, and had he been just a little faster, he could have brought the Russians to terms. We will show the world that it can be done."
 VIC_je_suis_la_deluge:1 "Je Suis Le Déluge"
 VIC_je_suis_la_deluge_desc:0 "The French revolution was the flood that swept away the old and weak regimes that had controlled Europe for so long. Now, a new flood is here."
 FRA_ban_communism_desc:0 "While it is inconceivable that anyone could seriously want to visit the chaos and bloodshed of a communist revolution upon their own fatherland, it appears that there are some amongst us who would do just that. We can not allow them to conspire against the state any longer. The harshest measures must be taken."

 VIC_full_employment:0 "Full Employment"
 VIC_full_employment_desc:0 "We are in the enviable position of having very low unemployment, partially because of the massive bloodshed of the Great War. However, this has made it difficult for companies to find skilled workers, and the military finds it hard to compete with the labour market for recruits. Extending the draft would only exaberate the problem. We should try and find other sources of manpower to make up for the shortfall, either in recruitment or in the economy."
 VIC_worker_shortage:0 "Worker Shortage"
 VIC_worker_shortage_desc:0 "The demands of the military have been allowed to overrule concerns about labour shortages. Many companies now report shortages in skilled workers that have started to affect production output. Easing up our conscription laws would allow people to return to the factories, but won't solve the underlying problems."
 VIC_inefficient_economy_1:0 "Inefficient Economy"
 VIC_inefficient_economy_1_desc:0 "While still a major industrialized country, France has been left behind in terms of concentration of production capabilities. Major reforms are needed to make our economy more competitive in the global scale."
