shock_troops:0"Assault Troops I"
shock_troops_desc:0"While warfare was revolutionized with the invention of the tank, many nations realized that reforms in infantry equipment and tactics would also be needed. Germany were the first to capitalize on this in the Great War with the invention of the Stoßtruppen or “Assault Trooper”. While warfare has changed entirely from that of the Great War, it is clear that this new war on the horizon will require troops with fast and powerful offensive tactics to overcome the enemy where normal infantry and tanks cannot. These modern assault troopers are extensively trained in not only open warfare in fields and forests but also close-quarters infiltration tactics; giving them the edge in urban warfare as well as overcoming enemy strongpoints and forts. These troops will require longer and more advanced training as well the best equipment available in order for them to achieve their purpose."
